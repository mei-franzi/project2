this R markdown aims to comprehensivesly show the sample selection processs. It includes a sample summary, a feasiblity matrix, examines the distribution of the data and contains some information from the literature, such as the influence of sample size on statistical power. Generally, the more samples the better. DESeq performs best when sample size is five or higher. DESeq2 is the tool of choice.

### Power and Tool Selection Priorities in RNA-seq Analysis

Tool choice on differential expression analysis, for read alignment, expression modeling and DEG identification, impacts performance. 
Based on systematic evaluation of RNA-seq differential expression workflows, the following hierarchy of factors are important:

#### 1. Sample Size (Primary Factor)

**Baccarella et al. (2018)** [empirical assessment](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2445-2) demonstrated that:

- Read depth has little effect on workflow performance when held above **two million reads per sample**
- **Increasing biological replicates increases power or gene recall more drastically than increasing read depth**

**Ching et al. (2014)** [power analysis study](https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.046011.114) confirmed:

- **The dominant contributing factor to reach optimal power is sample size**, rather than sequencing depth
- Optimal sequencing depth around **20 million reads range** for most DE detection packages

#### 2. Tool Selection (Distribution-Dependent)

**Li et al. (2022)** [method comparison](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264246) found tool performance varies by sample size and data distribution:

**For negative binomial distribution:**

- **n=3 per group:** EBSeq performed better than other methods (FDR control, power, stability)
- **n=6-12 per group:** DESeq2 performed slightly better than other methods

**For log-normal distribution:**

- **DESeq and DESeq2** methods performed better across all sample sizes (FDR control, power, stability)

**Overall tool recommendations:**

- **DESeq2 and edgeR** appear to be the better choices for overall performance

#### 3. Read Depth (Secondary Factor)

Performance of DEG identification workflows is measured by:

- **Precision:** fraction of genes correctly identified as differentially expressed
- **Recall:** fraction of DEGs identified

Tool choice impacts performance across read alignment, expression modeling, and DEG identification steps.

## Expression Distribution Analysis

### Data Distribution Assessment


```{r load-data-and-analysis, fig.height=10, fig.width=12}
# Sample 5000 genes for robust distribution analysis
set.seed(123)
sample_genes <- sample(nrow(counts), 5000)
sample_counts <- as.matrix(counts[sample_genes, ])

# Calculate mean-variance relationship
gene_means <- rowMeans(sample_counts)
gene_vars <- apply(sample_counts, 1, var)

# Remove genes with zero variance or mean
valid_genes <- gene_means > 0 & gene_vars > 0
gene_means_clean <- gene_means[valid_genes]
gene_vars_clean <- gene_vars[valid_genes]

# Quantify overdispersion
overdispersion_ratio <- gene_vars_clean / gene_means_clean
pct_overdispersed <- round(mean(overdispersion_ratio > 1, na.rm = TRUE) * 100, 1)
mean_overdispersion <- round(mean(overdispersion_ratio, na.rm = TRUE), 2)
median_overdispersion <- round(median(overdispersion_ratio, na.rm = TRUE), 2)

# Display metrics
cat("Valid genes analyzed:", length(gene_means_clean), "\n")
cat("Overdispersed genes:", pct_overdispersed, "%\n")
cat("Mean overdispersion ratio:", mean_overdispersion, "\n")

# Create data frame for ggplot
plot_data <- data.frame(
  mean_expr = gene_means_clean,
  variance = gene_vars_clean
)


# Create the plot
p1 <- ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = mean_expr, y = variance)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Mean expression",
    y = "Variance", 
    title = "Mean-Variance Relationship",
    subtitle = "Distribution Assessment"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  annotate("text", x = max(gene_means_clean) * 0.7, y = max(gene_vars_clean) * 0.9, 
           label = "Red line: Var = Mean (Poisson)\nBlue line: Observed relationship", 
           color = "black", size = 3)
p1

```
### Results Interpretation

**Distribution Assessment Results:**

- **Valid genes analyzed:** `r length(gene_means_clean)` genes
- **Overdispersed genes:** `r pct_overdispersed`% show variance > mean  
- **Mean overdispersion ratio:** `r mean_overdispersion` 
- **Median overdispersion ratio:** `r median_overdispersion`

**Conclusion:** With `r pct_overdispersed`% of genes showing overdispersion and a mean ratio of `r mean_overdispersion`, our data clearly follows a **negative binomial distribution** rather than Poisson or log-normal.

**Statistical Method Implications:**
Based on Li et al. (2022), for negative binomial data:

- Groups with n=3: EBSeq recommended
- Groups with n≥6: DESeq2 optimal
- Our sample sizes require careful method selection per comparison

## Experimental Design Assessment
This section evaluates sample sizes across experimental groups to identify statistically viable comparisons. 

- minimum samples per group: 3 

```{r feasibility-matrix}
# Create feasibility matrix with sample sizes per experimental group
feasibility_matrix <- metadata %>%
  dplyr::count(tissue, age_group, strain_group, treatment_group, treatment_duration, biological_group) %>%
  complete(tissue, age_group, strain_group, treatment_group, treatment_duration, fill = list(n = 0))

# Add power categories based on sample size
feasibility_matrix <- feasibility_matrix %>%
  mutate(
    power_tier = case_when(
      n >= 5 ~ "Adequate",       
      n == 3 | n == 4 ~ "Borderline",  
      n == 1 | n == 2 ~ "Insufficient",   
      n == 0 ~ "No samples"),
    # Recreate biological_group for the zero-count rows created by complete()
    biological_group = case_when(
      !is.na(biological_group) ~ biological_group,  # Keep existing values
      strain_group == "4F" & treatment_group == "Dox" ~ "reprogrammed",
      strain_group == "4F" & treatment_group == "control" ~ "transgene",
      strain_group == "WT" & treatment_group == "Dox" ~ "WT_Dox",
      strain_group == "WT" & treatment_group == "control" ~ "WT"))

# Filter to only groups with samples
existing_groups <- feasibility_matrix %>%
  filter(n > 0) %>%
  arrange(tissue, desc(n))

# Distribution of sample sizes
sample_size_dist <- existing_groups %>%
  dplyr::count(n, name = "n_groups") %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(n_groups / sum(n_groups) * 100, 1))

### Experimental Group Abbreviations

```{r abbreviation-table}
# Create abbreviation reference table
abbreviation_guide <- data.frame(
 Category = c(rep("Age", 3), rep("Strain/Treatment", 4), rep("Duration", 3)),
 Abbreviation = c("young", "old", "v.old",
                  "4F+", "4F-", "WT+", "WT-",
                  "1m", "7m", "10m"),
 Full_Description = c("3 months (baseline control)",
                      "22 months",
                      "25-26 months (very old)",
                      "Transgenic 4F with Dox (reprogrammed)",
                      "Transgenic 4F control (no treatment)",
                      "Wildtype with Dox",
                      "Wildtype control",
                      "1 month treatment (short)",
                      "7 months treatment (long)",
                      "10 months treatment (extended)"))

kable(abbreviation_guide, caption = "Abbreviation Guide for Experimental Groups")
```

### Critical Gap Analysis

```{r young-control-analysis}
# Check which tissues have young control groups
young_controls <- existing_groups %>%
  filter(age_group == "young", treatment_group == "control") %>%
  dplyr::select(tissue, strain_group, treatment_duration, n)

# Tissues with ANY young samples
tissues_with_young <- existing_groups %>%
  filter(age_group == "young") %>%
  distinct(tissue) %>%
  pull(tissue)

# Tissues lacking young controls
all_tissues <- unique(existing_groups$tissue)
tissues_without_young <- setdiff(all_tissues, tissues_with_young)

kable(young_controls, caption = "Available Young Control Groups")

cat("\nTissues completely lacking young samples:", 
    paste(tissues_without_young, collapse = ", "))
```

- Best coverage: Kidney and Liver tissues show the most complete experimental designs
- Limited comparisons: The sparsity of adequate sample sizes constrains the number of meaningful differential expression analyses possible
-  tissues_with_young control group are "Kidney" "Liver"  "Lung"   "Muscle" "Skin"   "Spleen" 


### Sample and Group selection 

- based on numbers of samples, and rejuventation-efficiency, the 7-month treatment duration and young 4F control mice  will be retained. 
- Skeletal muscle is excluded. No seven-month treatment group, no young controls. 

```{r key comparison selection}
# Subset metadata to focus on key comparisons
metadata_focused <- metadata %>%
 filter(treatment_duration == "7m" | age_group == "young")

# Update biological_group for young samples
metadata_focused <- metadata_focused %>%
  mutate(biological_group = ifelse(age_group == "young", "young_transgene", biological_group))


# Count samples per tissue and group
group_summary <- metadata_focused %>%
  dplyr::count(tissue, biological_group) %>%
  arrange(tissue, desc(n))

group_summary <- group_summary %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = biological_group, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>%
  dplyr::select(tissue, 
                reprogrammed = reprogrammed,
                WT = WT,
                young_transgene = young_transgene)

kable(group_summary, caption = "Sample Counts per Tissue and Group (Final Format)")
```

### Gene Filtering Strategy

To ensure high-quality and interpretable gene expression data, we applied a structured, multi-step filtering approach. Each step removes a specific class of low-quality or non-informative genes, while preserving biologically relevant signals in our three-group design (Reprogrammed, Wildtype, Young).

1. **MinCount Filter**  
   Removes genes with no meaningful raw expression in any sample.  
   Genes are retained if at least one sample shows raw counts ≥ 1 (`minCount = 1`).  
   This reduces noise and prevents low-count genes from inflating dispersion estimates in downstream modeling.

2. **Relevance Filter**  
   Keeps genes that show moderate expression in at least one biological group.  
   For each gene, it checks whether ≥ 75% of samples in any treatment group (Dox-4F, Control, or Young) have normalized expression (CPM) ≥ `minCount`.  
   This removes genes that are only sporadically or weakly expressed across all conditions and would lack statistical power.

3. **Spurious Spikes Filter**  
   Identifies and removes genes where expression is dominated by a single sample in **multiple** groups — a pattern often caused by technical artifacts such as barcode contamination or PCR amplification bias.  

   #### ✱ Revised Implementation:
   The original version of this filter included an additional **quantile-based check** that removed genes with large differences in median expression between groups.  
   However, this was **removed** in the current pipeline to avoid discarding **true biological signals**.  
   Since we are explicitly comparing young and aged animals, we expect genuine, strong differences in expression across treatment groups.  
   Retaining the **spike-based filter alone** ensures technical artifacts are controlled for, without filtering out biologically important genes.

All filters are applied **after DESeq2 normalization**, and are fully compatible with multi-group designs.


### Filtering and Preprocessing Across Tissues

We applied a standardized pipeline across all tissues to ensure consistency in normalization and gene filtering. For each tissue:

1. Raw counts were subset to include only matching samples.
2. A DESeq2 dataset was created using `~ treatment` as the design.
3. The dataset was normalized using `DESeq()`.
4. Filtering was applied in three stages:
   - **MinCount filter** (remove low-count genes)
   - **Relevance filter** (retain genes expressed in at least one group)
   - **Spurious spikes filter** (remove genes dominated by single samples in multiple groups)

The filtering pipeline was executed per tissue using a reusable function. The number of genes remaining after each step is summarized in the table below.
